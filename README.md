# Task List 2021

A simple task list web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, making it an easy-to-use tool for managing daily tasks.

## Features

- **Edit Task**: Each task has an "Edit" button, which toggles the task between read-only and editable modes.
- **Delete Task**: Each task has a "Delete" button, which removes the task from the list when clicked.

## Technologies Used

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the app.
